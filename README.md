Summary: Developed an exclusive e-commerce platform for artisans to sell their products. The demand forecast of the items required, automatic quality checks on the items as well as Sentiment analysis with next recommendation actions for the artist shall be added. 


In a culturally diverse country like India, some variables increase the issues that handicrafts face. Among the challenges that artisans encounter is the lack of technical expertise, sales organisation, education, low capital, unhealthy exposure, and, most critically, a lack of marketing intelligence and a poor framework.
By removing the middlemen from the equation, our platform makes it much easier for craftsmen/artisans to sell their goods. We intend to create a platform that allows artists to list their artefacts after a thorough quality check. We intend to create sustainable living for the Indian handicraft artisans alongside promoting a huge part of Indian culture and heritage.

This platform offers no-fuss navigation and a user-friendly UI and has features like advanced search powered by artificial intelligence to help visitors find relevant products as quickly as possible. We are also planning to equip our platform to seamlessly scale to every possible screen size and to integrate features like order management, product filtering, chatbot, different payment gateways and sales analytics.
